            <li>2/3 cup boiling water</li>
            <li>Some bamboo skewers</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Ingredients for the Sweet Soy Glaze </h2>
            <li>4 Tbsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>2/3 cup water</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp potato starch or cornstarch</li>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients for the dumplings and sweet soy glaze.</li>
            <li>Soak the bamboo skewers in water. You can also start boiling a large pot of water on low heat.</li>
            <li>Combine ⅔ cup joshinko (Japanese rice flour) and ¾ cup shiratamako (glutinous rice flour/sweet rice flour) in a bowl. Using chopsticks, mix it all together until well blended</li>
            <li>When the flours start to stick together and eventually form clumps, stop adding water. Using your hands, combine the dough into one ball.</li>
            <li>Knead until the dough becomes smooth. The texture is like squeezing an “earlobe“ (that’s how we describe the tenderness of this type of mochi in Japanese).</li>
            <li>Combine the dough into a ball. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.Then divide each piece into 2 smaller pieces. 
                You will have 16 equal-sized pieces of dough. I always like to weigh mine. Each ball should be 20 grams. You may have some extra dough, but that’s okay.</li>
            <li>Shape each of the dough pieces into a smooth, round ball. If the dough is cracking or has some wrinkles, dip the tip of your finger in water 
                and apply a small amount of water to the cracked area to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>Just before cooking the dumplings, prepare a bowl of iced water. Once the water in the pot is boiling, gently drop each dumpling into the pot with a smooth, continuous arm motion to avoid splashing. Cook them all at once. Stir the balls occasionally so they keep their round shape and don‘t stick to the bottom of the pot.
            </li>   
            <li>Transfer the dumplings to the bowl of iced water after they have risen to the top for 1-2 minutes.</li> 
            <li>Once they have cooled, Skewer three pieces onto a bamboo skewer. Continue with the rest of the dumplings and set aside.</li>
            <li>Make the sweet glaze: Mix all ingredients slowly in a cold saucepan. Continue mixing until smooth and then turn on the heat to continue whisking</li>
            <li>When the sauce thickens, remove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the sauce to a container or bowl. </li>
            <li>Optional: Sear and enhance the flavor with a kitchen butane torch. You can also grill them over direct heat </li>
            <li>Pour the sweet soy glaze on top of the Mitarashi Dango and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
